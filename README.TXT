This is my final project for Comp 464 (Computer Graphics) at CSUCI. It features
a 4-legged cube robot that scuttles through a scene. The user is able to freely
control a camera within the scene using the keys WASDQERFZX.

This project was built in Visual Studio 2013 and requires OpenGL 3.0 or greater.
The following files must be in the working directory:

vshader21.glsl
fshader21.glsl
sky.bmp
tessground.bmp
companion cube.bmp


Some of the code included in this repository originally came from
http://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SIXTH_EDITION/

The code for the shaders and parts of the scene came from an in-class example.

The image in "companion cube.bmp" came from somewhere on the web. The other
images are mine. All resources in this repository not covered by any other
